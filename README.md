# Late Fees
Hi! This is an Excel project that I created for my job. This is a real-world project that is used to help make data-driven decisions.  

**IMPORTANT:** For confidentiality reasons, all managerial and company names are fictitious and have nothing to do with real people or companies. This does not affect the technical part of the project.

## About the Project
Currently, I work as a middle accounts receivable representative in the real estate sphere. I'm responsible for several processes in the company. One of the processes is called late fees. These are charges that tenants receive for overdue rent payments. We work with several clients each of which have own rules and deadlines. Each manager in my team is responsible for one or more clients. We use a third-party website to organize information related to this process, but, in my opinion, it's not quite informative. It doesn't show all the information that I need. The format is also not that convenient. To solve this problem, I decided to create a report in Excel. The idea is simple - I download a table with late fee data from the third-party website and upload it into Excel. Then, the dashboard, which is already in the file, uses formulas, pivot tables, and charts to perform calculations and display all the information I need.

I can upload a new table any time I need, and the dashboard will update automatically. This helps me to keep track of the process and make data-driven decisions.  

The information displayed on the dashboard:
- Posting progress in percentage
- Statuses for our clients (Completed, Working on it, etc.)
- Posting intensity throughout the month
- Client distribution between the managers
- Clients that haven't received late fees yet this month
- Reason for not receiving late fees
- Deadline deviation

## Used Instruments 
For this project, I used Excel. The dataset is small, so Excel fully satisfies all needs.

## Functions and Techniques
The following list represents some of the Excel functions and techniques utilized within the project:
- Pivot tables
- Pivot charts
- Conditional formatting
- Functions (IF, LEN, RIGHT, COUNTIF, FILTER, XLOOKUP, COUNTA, TEXTSPLIT, TRANSPOSE, HSTACK)
- Combining multiple functions in complex formulas

## Next Steps
I consider this project to be fully scalable. It allows us to work with bigger datasets in the future, in case we start cooperating with more clients. It also has room for implementing additional calculations and charts if required. The project met my professional needs and proved itself useful. I will continue working on it and will improve consistently.
